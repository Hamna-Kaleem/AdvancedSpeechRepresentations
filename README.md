🎵 Speech Signal Analysis Repository

📌 Overview

This repository provides a detailed comparison of different speech signal representations, moving beyond basic waveforms to more informative representations like envelope, RMS energy, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and spectrograms (STFT, Mel, MFCC).

📂 Contents

Waveform Representation – Raw amplitude over time.

Envelope Extraction – Smoothed energy variations.

RMS Energy Curve – Loudness estimation over time.

Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) – Speech vs. noise differentiation.

Spectrograms:

STFT Spectrogram – Basic time-frequency representation.

Mel Spectrogram – Mimics human auditory perception.

MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) – Common for speech recognition.

🚀 Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with the required dependencies:

pip install numpy librosa matplotlib scipy

📊 Usage

Run the script to generate and visualize different speech representations.

python analysis.py example.wav

Replace example.wav with your own audio file.
