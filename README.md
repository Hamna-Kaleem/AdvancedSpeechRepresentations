**🎵 Advanced Speech Signal Representations**

**📌 Overview**

This repository provides a detailed comparison of different speech signal representations, moving beyond basic waveforms to more informative representations like envelope, RMS energy, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and spectrograms (STFT, Mel, MFCC).

**📂 Contents**

Waveform Representation – Raw amplitude over time.

Envelope Extraction – Smoothed energy variations.

RMS Energy Curve – Loudness estimation over time.

Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) – Speech vs. noise differentiation.

Spectrograms:

  STFT Spectrogram – Basic time-frequency representation.

  Mel Spectrogram – Mimics human auditory perception.

MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) – Common for speech recognition.

**🚀 Installation**

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with the required dependencies:

_**pip install numpy librosa matplotlib scipy**_

**📊 Usage**

Run the script to generate and visualize different speech representations.

  python analysis.py example.wav

  Replace example.wav with your own audio file.
